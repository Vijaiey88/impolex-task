# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain

## Overview


This project aims to predict employee base salaries based on features such as Department, Department Name, Division, Gender, Overtime pay, Longevity pay and Grade. The project leverages machine learning models to analyze these features and make accurate salary predictions.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9
Required Python libraries:
- os
- PyPDF2
- langchain_openai
- langchain_community
- langchain_community.vectorstores
- langchain_community.chat_models
- langchain.prompts
- langchain.memory
- langchain.text_splitter
## Conclusion

This project provides a basic implementation of a Retrieval Augmented Generation system using LangChain. It can be extended and customized based on specific needs for handling and querying PDF documents.
