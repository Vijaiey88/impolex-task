Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahirmaharajj/employee-salaries-analysis/data
Features: `Department_Name`,`Department`, `Division`, `Gender`, `Grade`, `Overtime Pay`, `Longevity Pay`, `Base Salary`

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone 
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd employee-salary-prediction
```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Modeling

The project uses various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. The following steps are included in the modeling process:

1. Data Preprocessing : Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset.
2. Model Training: Training models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or other suitable algorithms.
3. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.
## Results

The final model's performance is evaluated, and the results are documented. The model with the best performance is selected for deployment.
